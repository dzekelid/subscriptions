      summary: Delete Customers Customer Subscriptions Subscription Exposed
      description: Cancels a customer???s subscription. If you set the at_period_end
        parameter to true, the subscription will remain active until the end of the
        period, at which point it will be canceled and not renewed. By default, the
        subscription is terminated immediately. In either case, the customer will
        not be charged again for the subscription. Note, however, that any pending
        invoice items that you???ve created will still be charged for at the end of
        the period unless manually deleted. If you???ve set the subscription to cancel
        at period end, any pending prorations will also be left in place and collected
        at the end of the period, but if the subscription is set to cancel immediately,
        pending prorations will be removed.By default, all unpaid invoices for the
        customer will be closed upon subscription cancellation. We do this in order
        to prevent unexpected payment attempts once the customer has canceled a subscription.
        However, you can reopen the invoices manually after subscription cancellation
        to have us proceed with payment collection, or you could even re-attempt payment
        yourself on all unpaid invoices before allowing the customer to cancel the
        subscription at all.

      summary: Delete Subscriptions Subscription Exposed
      description: Cancels a customer???s subscription. If you set the at_period_end
        parameter to true, the subscription will remain active until the end of the
        period, at which point it will be canceled and not renewed. By default, the
        subscription is terminated immediately. In either case, the customer will
        not be charged again for the subscription. Note, however, that any pending
        invoice items that you???ve created will still be charged for at the end of
        the period unless manually deleted. If you???ve set the subscription to cancel
        at period end, any pending prorations will also be left in place and collected
        at the end of the period, but if the subscription is set to cancel immediately,
        pending prorations will be removed.By default, all unpaid invoices for the
        customer will be closed upon subscription cancellation. We do this in order
        to prevent unexpected payment attempts once the customer has canceled a subscription.
        However, you can reopen the invoices manually after subscription cancellation
        to have us proceed with payment collection, or you could even re-attempt payment
        yourself on all unpaid invoices before allowing the customer to cancel the
        subscription at all.
